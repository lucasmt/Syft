Compilation Instructions for Syft using CMake

==== Install CUDD ====

0.1 Make sure CUDD is installed. CUDD can be found at:
    https://github.com/ivmai/cudd.git

0.2 Install CUDD:
    ./configure --enable-slient-rules --enable-obj --enable-dddmp --prefix=[install location]
    sudo make install

    If you get an error about aclocal, this might be due to either
    a. Not having automake:
       sudo apt-get install automake
    b. Needing to reconfigure, do this before configuring:
       autoreconf -i

==== Install FLEX, BISON ====

0.3 Install flex and bison:
    sudo apt-get install flex bison

==== Install MONA ====

0.4 You probably want MONA if you are using Syft:
    sudo apt-get install mona

==== Install Syft ====

1. Make build folder so your directory is not flooded with build files:

   mkdir build && cd build

2. Run CMake to generate the makefile:

   cmake ..

3. Compile using the generated makefile:

   make
   
==== Instructions for IJCAI 2019 ====

The modified version of Syft used in the paper "Partitioning Techniques in LTLf Synthesis" (Tabajara and Vardi, IJCAI 2019) is available in the branch `ijcai2019`. This version has additional dependencies that must be installed from source. To install this version, perform steps 0.1-0.4 above, and before building Syft as normal, perform the following additional steps:

0.5 Install JET from:
    https://bitbucket.org/lucas-mt/jet/
    
0.6 Install RSynth from the `remaster` branch of:
    https://bitbucket.org/lucas-mt/rsynth/
    
0.7 If necessary, set the variables JET_ROOT and RSYNTH_ROOT in CMakeModules/Findjet.cmake and CMakeModules/Findrsynth.cmake, respectively.
